Good morning, everyone. Let's get started by reviewing our key action items for this week. We’ve got a full agenda, and I appreciate everyone being on time.

The Concept Bravo marketing proposal has been updated, and the revised version will be circulated by the end of the day. A budget impact analysis is also underway—Finance needed some clarifications before finalizing the numbers. Despite that, the distribution timeline remains on track. A meeting with Procurement is scheduled for later today to finalize vendor costs, and if that goes smoothly, everything should proceed as planned.

From the Marketing side, work is progressing on researching competitor strategies for similar campaigns. Three have already been benchmarked, and insights are still coming in. A full report is expected by July 1st. Social performance metrics will be added as well, with data already gathered from Meta and LinkedIn. Twitter’s analytics are slightly delayed but should be available tomorrow.

Drafting of Q3 sales target adjustments has begun, showing some regional variation. Input from the Southeast team will be needed, and the plan is to present to management next Monday. Support in consolidating dashboard data will be appreciated, especially due to a discrepancy in lead conversion data that needs a closer look.

On Project Capstone, QA flagged a need for additional resources for regression testing. A resource request has been drafted and a meeting with QA leads is scheduled for this afternoon. All Dev Team members are expected to review the Capstone beta feedback individually by July 21st, ideally spending 30–45 minutes with the annotated test logs. Feedback should be documented clearly, using severity-level tags to help with prioritization during sprint planning. Major, minor, and UI-only bugs have already been tagged separately in JIRA.

The wellness initiative is also kicking off this week, with an interview schedule for participant selection drafted. Interviews are set for July 28th, and initial surveys are being prepared to guide the discussion. It was suggested that Facilities or Admin be included in the wellness conversations, especially given that workspace ergonomics is one of the focus areas. That recommendation will be acted upon.

Support reported a critical login issue last night, and a temporary workaround was implemented early this morning. The issue is now stable, but a permanent fix is needed. The workaround has been documented and shared with Support and Product teams, including a Loom walkthrough. This issue could impact NPS scores if it recurs, so it will be noted in the Customer Experience (CX) review report, and the CX team will be alerted accordingly.

The Design team is finalizing UI assets for Capstone this week. Once completed, front-end integration will follow ahead of the next demo. The assets are expected by the end of the week and have been previewed—they’re clean and mobile-friendly.

The wellness pilot will start with three focus areas: mental health, ergonomics for remote teams, and flexible scheduling. There is interest in participating, especially in flexible scheduling, and more team members are encouraged to reach out after the meeting to be added.

There are plans to compile FAQ updates based on recent customer feedback. The latest Zendesk tags will be exported and summarized to identify the most common queries. The goal is to update the FAQ by mid-next week, using the new CMS templates.

There were inconsistencies noted between the staging and production environments. DevOps will be asked to run a configuration diff to identify discrepancies.

To speed up feedback cycles, automated test runs for critical paths are being considered. This should reduce manual QA time by 20–30%. Additionally, it was proposed—and agreed—that bug triage sessions be consolidated into biweekly meetings, scheduled for Tuesdays at 3 PM starting next week.

The marketing creative team will present campaign visuals this Friday at 11 AM, and all are welcome to attend. This has been added to the shared calendar.

The accessibility review for Capstone has been scheduled for next Thursday, using the WCAG 2.1 checklist.

As the meeting wrapped up, remaining blockers were reviewed. Aside from pending mockups, no critical blockers were reported.

Next steps will be shared in a summary, including action items and deadlines. The team will reconvene next Thursday at the same time, with mid-sprint updates expected.

Everyone acknowledged the meeting with thanks and confirmed their attendance for next week.

Meeting adjourned with a wish for a productive week ahead.
